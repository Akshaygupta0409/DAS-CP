    the main idea of this was to find the msb of k now why to do that ?
    1 << msb - 1 this does give the max no of set bits int that number 

}

2.  https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/ {
    also in algozenith : the idea is to take xor of all elemnts .
    but why ?
    xor of all elemnts will give you number now if the ith bit is set it means that at that pos either ith bit of b is 0 ans a is 1  or vice versa
    as we have taken the xor of values
}

// very beautiful idea which works on (subarray AND  , subarray OR);
