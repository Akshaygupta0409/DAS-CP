## Concepts and Techniques in DSA-CP

## Little Techniques

Below is a list of directories that showcase various algorithmic techniques along with tips on time complexity and common pitfalls:

- 4_star_problem: Focuses on challenging problems with varying time complexities; pitfalls include combinatorial explosion and misinterpretation of problem constraints.
- Binary_search: Time Complexity: O(log n). Common pitfalls: off-by-one errors and infinite loops.
- DSU: Nearly O(Î±(n)) per operation with path compression. Watch out for union-by-rank mistakes.
- Dynamic_programing: Time Complexity depends on subproblem overlap; common pitfalls include improper memoization and state misrepresentation.
- Fenwick_tree (aka bit): Provides O(log n) updates and queries. Common pitfalls: indexing errors and update propagation issues.
- Greedy: Often yields linear or O(n log n) performance; pitfalls include not fulfilling the greedy choice property.
- Ideas: Contains conceptual exercises with varied complexities; always analyze theoretical performance.
- Observations: Offers practical insights; be wary of hidden costs in implementation.
- Range_maintanence: Often uses segment trees; typical query/update complexity is O(log n); pitfalls include managing lazy propagation.
- Stack: Fundamental for simulating recursions and parsing; ensure to handle deep recursions to avoid stack overflow.
- Tries: Usually O(L) per operation, where L is the length of the key; caution for high memory usage.
- graph: Includes a variety of algorithms like DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra; pitfalls include handling cycles and disconnected components.
