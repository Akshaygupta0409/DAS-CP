in this problem 
1. i did needed to keep tack of money which is the amount of petorl that i am filling up at a given node.

2. identify which paramter you are optimizing on (very importnat )

3. where i got confused {
    i got confused in related this problem to the odinary dijkatra's problme 
    (in dijkatra's we optimize on weight but in this we optimize on petrol taken a.k.a money )

}

4. in this identifying state and transation is similiar as identify state in a dp probelm 
   so in graph probelm just solve it for a linear chain on change is we use dijkatra becaue it
   contians cycles
